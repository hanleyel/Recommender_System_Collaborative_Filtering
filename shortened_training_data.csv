A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B00005JL99,Matthew King,"[3, 6]","One thing to be said about Japanese horror/extreme action is that it could seldom, if ever, be accused of being formulaic.  Some of the most ingenious storylines ever thought of have come from Japanese films(see Ringu, Suicide Club, Kairo, Uzumaki).  But while the ideas are in place the problem is often with the execution of the film.  Overacting, cheap special effects and slow pacing between action scenes have often plagued the Japanese films I have bore witness to.  Not so with Battle Royale.  The concept is pure genius and believe me, the execution even better.Kitano is a strict teacher whose source of pride comes from being able to instill discipline in the young.  He is for the most part very successful at this and highly respected among his students.  Then one afternoon, an out-of-control student who he reprimands stabs him in the back of the leg.  Following this incident Kitano quits his teaching job and disappears out of sight.  Fast forward to a few years later.  A group of 42 students(who appear to be in their mid-teens) board a bus to go on a class trip.  At some point during the bus ride a sleeping gas is unleashed and all the students fall asleep.  When they wake up, they find themselves cramped in a classroom and with a tight metallic necklace tied around their necks.  To their great surprise, in through the door walks Kitano, who most have had as a 7th grade teacher.  Kitano informs them of a game he has devised called Battle Royale that they have been randomly selected to be a part of.  Battle Royale is Kitano's sadistic vengeful way of getting back to the youths he feels lack discipline and `mock' adults.The rules behind Battle Royale are this; The students are now on a remote island where all 42 of them will be pitted against each other in a game to the death.  Each student is given a backpack that includes water, food, a weapon, a compass and a map of the island.  The last person standing gets to go home free.  There is a catch however.  They only have 3 days.  If more than one person is left standing after 3 days, their collars will all blow.  The island is also mapped with regions that contain shifting `danger zones', of which Kitano informs them of over a loud speaker.  If someone is still standing in a danger zone after Kitano makes the announcement their collar will explode.From the moment the rules of Battle Royale are transmitted to the kids, the film's frenetic pace never lets up.  Director Kinji Fukasaku pulls absolutely no punches here, making this a no-holds-barred extreme version of Lord of the Flies that is compulsively watchable.  The acting performances he is able to draw out of these kids is remarkable.  Part of what Fukasaku seems to be trying to achieve with this film is to give us a character study of how different some kids can be from others and how differently they can react when faced with peril.  One group commits suicide instantly, refusing to be a part of the sadistic game they're forced to play.  Another group spends their time shacked up in a cabin, trying to figure out a way to hack through Kitano's system so they can get the collars off their necks.  One group of women simply decide to live as normally as they usually would by cooking, exchanging stories, staying civilized.  And of course, some kids choose to become killing machines, determined to be the one to get out of the game alive.Director Fukasaku's choice of filming locations is absolutely stunning, from the lush tropical jungles, to the edge of the sea, the lighthouse, etc.  The film's image looks surprisingly sharp and clear for a non-hollywood production.  The only thing I would have to complain about are the English subtitles.  They are filled with grammatical errors and poor sentence structuring.  I also got the impression that many parts of the dialogue were missing or were not presented accurately.  Hopefully, Battle Royale will see a North American DVD reissue that will be dubbed or at least have better subtitles.  I'm not hoping for a North American remake however.  It would probably be a PG-13 `message' film starring the likes of Frankie Muniz and the Olsen twins. Ugh!!Battle Royale is an action classic not to be missed.  It's adrenaline-fuelled pace will appeal to action fans, it's bloody carnage and gore will appeal to horror fans.  This is a film that puts just about any North American action film to shame. A modern cult classic that deserves a wider distribution.",5.0,Absolutely stunning! A battle not to be missed!,1069200000,"11 19, 2003"

She's fun, charming, and more beautiful then ever.The script and direction are well done by Amy Heckerling and it's nice to see her re-team with some of the cast that shined in her crowning-achievement, Clueless (Stacey Dash, Wallace Shawn, and of course, Paul Rudd).This is definitely a fun romantic comedy worth seeing.

Rented the DVD, and quite frankly loved it. Tommy Lee Jones does a great job as the cantankerous grandfather, and Cate Blanchett was excellent as the hardened rancher.The plot: When a rancher's daughter is kidnapped she appeals to her estranged tracker grandfather for assistance. Together they track the kidnappers across the frontier and face mutual hardship. Can they save her Lilly or is she doomed for slavery in Mexico?I really liked the film. The cinematography was beautiful and I liked the scenes with the Native American actors. I did think some scenes were unnecessarily gruesome (the murdered ranch hands), (the tooth removal scene), but that's what the fast forward button is for.

AQRODCIYD7PYX,B003KV3E2W,"Robert F. Powers ""show maniac""","[4, 9]","Neighbor is a plotless movie that is strictly made to show a series of sadistic and horrifyingly systematic torture and slaughter of helpless victims.  The sadist is a young woman, obviously insane but no explanation is given who she is and why she is doing these unflinchingly depicted murders.  The unknown actress playing the role has to know this will be her first and last movie role because who in their right mind would ever hire her unless it was the Marquis DeSade.Since there is no real storyline I will cite a few of the ways people are tortured so this will be a warning to whether someone out there would ever want to watch this sickening piece of trash.A young girl has her mouth sawed open leaving her with a lop-sided grin that stretches ear to ear.This same young girl is cut open from the crook of her elbow to her wrist until her blood gushes out faster than an over-flowing bathtub. However the stage blood in this scene is not even convincing stage blood and looks like watered down tomato juice.She really goes to town on this same girls' boyfriend.  She uses a sharp instrument to turn his big toes to mush.  This is the nicest thing she does to him. She also punctures his cheek with a dentists' pick.  uses an electric drill to bore through his thigh and de-caps his knee with a pizza cutter. She also inserts a long sharp instrument into the young mans' penis and although it's obvious it was a prosthetic the scene is so vivid and squeamish I felt the pain in my own penis.The sadistic young woman also electrocutes, poisons and burns someone alive.This, I hesitate to call it a movie is a gorehounds delight and from the five-star ""plant"" reviewers you would think this is the best movie ever made.  It isn't. Not by a long shot. And since there is no reason for the gruesome going-ons(even Freddy Krueger had a motive in the original ""Nightmare On Elm Street), i can not recommend this sadistic piece of trash but it does deliver in the gore department and blows even ""Hostel"" in the torture genre out of the water.I happened to see the R-eated version of this picture and there is an unrated directors cut out there.

Pitof, opened 19 September, 2001, in Belgium) - The incredibly bloated G&eacute;rard Depardieu plays real-life detective/criminologist Francois Vidocq in this fast-paced, dizzying ""steampunk"" adventure set around 1830. (And the French had no compunction claiming this was partly based on Vidocq's actual memoirs.)Vidocq is hot on the trail of three men he considers dangerous perverts with dark motives. They lead him to The Alchemist (Guillaume Canet), an urban legend Vidocq has been studying for some time. He concludes correctly that The Alchemist is a real man - and tracks him down mercilessly.The twists in the plot are not all that labyrinthine; some are quite predictable whilst others are silly. The end is half expected, half total surprise. What astonishes me is not only the technological achievements of the film, but the fact that as early as 2001, someone in France was wise enough to do the first ""steampunk"" film with Vidocq as its central character. As has been indicated, this, not George Lucas' ATTACK OF THE CLONES, is the first film ever to be shot 100% digitally (with the Sony digital 1080p 24 fps).It matters little; the film has a made-for-TV look to it that I cannot quite accustom myself to watching. Yet it held me riveted, fascinated, as much for its excellence, cinema for cinema's sake, as for the films it clearly inspired. VIDOCQ started a movement that one could say began with the very first HARRY POTTER, all HARRY POTTER films, and certainly will not end with SHERLOCK HOLMES or SHERLOCK HOLMES 2. Most likely the slightly cheaper production values and the unfortunate timing buried VIDOCQ. Let's resurrect it!Director Pitof is best known for directing 2004's disaster CATWOMAN and his visual effects supervision on ALIEN: RESURRECTION (my favorite ALIEN film). Watch for this easy-to-spot director, who has a great future. I can't say what is going to ultimately become of Depardieu (the wife asked me what I thought), or how many dozens more films will be inspired by this masterpiece.All I can tell you is get this early marvel - appreciate it, it's not tough to find and even the original French dvd has English subtitles if you need them. Truly marvelous, original cinema is just too rare these days - so own this sparkling original.An original has to be accepted warts and all: one need not be offput by them.",5.0,"Vidocq invented modern crime-fighting ... and steampunk, apparently",1321056000,"11 12, 2011"

I'm so glad I took my best friend's advice and checked her stuff out. This particular duo, Hudson, Day, and Randall are now on my fave list for comedy. The comedy here is real - not chock full of unnecessary sexual connotation and scatological references. Don't tell me films about people who are already married and trying to stay together are boring. Hudson and Day are proof of that. The script in this film is great - far more original than anything I've seen lately. Hudson is a hypochondriac who mistakenly believes he's been diagnosed with only a few weeks to live. The film's play on hypochondriacs is great in and of itself - right on the nose about this type of personality! His task to find a new husband for Day weaves a great web of complicated misunderstandings that leave you rolling. The film is full of great detail. I particularly like the way the filmmakers actually found someone to make Rock Hudson look small and puny - the scenes between Hudson and his wife's &quot;future husband&quot; are hilarious. My husband almost choked watching this hulk of a man trying to climb out of a fashionable little sports car. Ladies, my 27 year old husband liked this film as much as I did.

And for the record? The Fat Girl is the smartest character in the movie, though the least attractive. She just suffers from lack of will-power and assertiveness. Skinny girl was not the most intelligent being ever to grace this planet.The abrupt ending was a bit cheesy and smacked of the writer wanting to wrap everything up in &lt; 5 minutes. But, it was not without value and provided a interesting insight into Chubby.The reason we can have one sister be fat and one thin, and both eating the same diet, is genetics.

If you were disappointed by ""The Blair Witch Project"" (a harrowing film about being lost, not about witches) or ""Open Water"" (a film more reliant on the drama of helplessness than on shark scares), then you will probably see little point to ""Frozen."" If, however, the very real frights of those films unsettled you--this film should tap into the same sensibilities and be right up your alley. An incredibly tense tale of three friends who are stranded on a ski lift, ""Frozen"" explores very real and powerful feelings of isolation and desperation as the trio comes to terms with their situation. Realizing that to survive is to act is only the first hurdle. Unfortunately, it seems as if nature itself is conspiring against the kids.""Frozen"" is a surprisingly sophisticated drama despite its very simple premise. The terror is understated and real (not at all what I was expecting from the director of the middling horror/comedy ""Hatchet""). Kevin Zegers, Shawn Ashmore, and Emma Bell do a fantastic job bringing this unpleasant experience to life. From joking bravado, to quiet desperation, to regret and recriminations, to acceptance and action--you really feel tapped into the emotions and fear of the protagonists. That's why ""Frozen"" is so disturbing and so great. The middle third of the film is so intense and memorable, it will definitely stick with me as one of the most horrifyingly bleak things I've seen this year! And while the film does strive for a ""scary"" payoff with a bigger action sequence at the finale, the palpable sense of danger of the film's quieter moments is never equaled.I truly think it is a disservice to market ""Frozen"" strictly in the horror category. It is most definitely a character driven drama. The horror of the premise is real and not manufactured for maximum scares. Great characterizations, effective performances and a slow-build tension distinguish ""Frozen"" as a harrowing and heartbreaking journey of human emotions. I hope that people will come to discover and appreciate ""Frozen."" It is my choice for one of the biggest sleepers of the year--I'm absolutely stunned by how well it achieves what it set out to do.

And, despite some criticism in a few reviews that the script contains too many homophobic jokes, the context in which they are told (most by Maxi's somewhat senile father, who doesn't seem to be able to stop himself) makes it clear that they are a product of the ignorance of the person speaking, reminiscent of Archie on ""All In The Family"" in the US.  Overall, I found this to be a well-written, positive and largely hysterical romantic comedy, much recommended to both gay and open-minded non-gay audiences.  Five (Michelin) stars out of five!DVD soundtrack is in Spanish with English subtitles. (Note that the film is very dialogue-intensive, so it takes a lot of constant reading to keep up with what is happening.)

Now depending how well and how much you take your werewolf mythology, I find 'Wolf' to be a great watch every time I get to see it.  You can never go wrong with this movie's all-star cast and unique storytelling, film-making that reminds me a lot of a classic Stephen King picture.  Jack Nicholson performance is well oiled, and does a fairly good job as the subhuman being. Jack's Eastwick co-star Michelle Pfeiffer rejoins him as a aloof and loveless woman who has manages to open her heart to the character and you can definitely see their Eastwick chemistry is not lost. The only thing that misses the mark slightly about the movie is Laura's  brother.  It is explained a little that he was a borderline schizophrenic and committed suicide.  Question is did this come from he probably being a wolf himself and couldn't handle it?  Or did the Aldens have the cursed wolf trait the whole time?

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[120, 126]","Three women, from different generations are still trying to heal from the horrors of the Third Reich and WWII more than fifty years after Germany surrendered to the Allied forces on May 7, 1945. The film's primary focus, however, is on a little girl who lost two mothers in a three year period - 1943 to 1946. She never received explanations for the horrors she lived through, nor did she have the opportunity to understand or express her pain. ""Rosenstrasse"" is set in 21st century New York City and Berlin, with flashbacks to Nazi Germany and Berlin in 1943.When Ruth Weinstein's, (Jutta Lampe), husband dies, she insists that the family observe a strictly Orthodox mourning period, even though they had never been observant Jews. Her son and daughter are both bewildered, and then angry, when Ruth forbids daughter Hannah, (Maria Schrader) to marry her Nicaraguan fiance Luis, ((Fedja van Huet). Luis is not Jewish, and although he was mentored by Hannah's now deceased father, and religion had never been a problem before, their plans for a life together are now up in the air. A distant cousin alludes that the source of Ruth's problems lies in the past, in Nazi Germany. She reveals to Hannah that her mother was cared for, in fact saved from certain death, by an Aryan woman during WWII. After the war Ruth immigrated to America to live with this cousin and her family, virtual strangers. Ruth had never discussed her childhood or her war experiences with her children. She always kept silent. And when Hannah probes once more she receives no answers, as always. She decides to fly to Germany to uncover the secrets of her mother's past.In Berlin, Hannah tracks down 90 year-old Lena Fischer, (Doris Schade), the Christian woman who brought seven year-old Ruth home to live with her, when the child's mother was imprisoned with other Berlin Jews in March, 1943. Hannah does not reveal her identity, but says she is conducting a study about Aryans and their Jewish spouses during the war. She listens intently, over a period of days, as the charming elderly woman finally reveals the facts about her own life and Ruth's, both so closely intertwined.Thousands of Berlin's Jews were swept up from their forced labor jobs and taken to Rosenstrasse 2-4, in central Berlin in March 1943. This was meant to be the capital's final round-up for the Final Solution, and the Jews were to be deported to concentration camps from Rosenstrasse. Ruth's mother was one of these unfortunate people. Left alone without a ration card, the child would not have survived without Lena's assistance. (The younger Lena is played by Katja Riemann, who gives a powerful performance). Her husband, Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel), a brilliant violinist, was also taken to Rosenstrasse. Lena was a concert pianist and met Fabian through their mutual love for music. She married against her aristocratic parents wishes and was disowned by all, except her brother Arthur. As with most marriages between Aryans and Jews, the Aryans were pressured heavily by the Nazi State, their employers, and usually friends and family to divorce their Jewish spouses. Most who refused were marginalized, but they still maintained their status as Aryans and German citizens, and as such their Jewish mates were supposedly protected from deportation.Lena joins a group of women waiting for word of their husbands, keeping vigil, outside the building on Rosenstrasse. It is here that Lena meets the frightened and bewildered Ruth, who knows her mother is in the building, but never is actually told that she has been deported already. Svea Lohde plays Ruth, as a young girl, with great sensitivity. She has nowhere to go and no one to turn to, so Lena steps in, in spite of her fear of discovery for hiding a Jewish child. Lena and Ruth form a strong bond, a surrogate mother-daughter relationship which will last for three years. Director Margarethe von Trotta emphasizes throughout Ruth's heartbreaking ignorance of her mother's fate. The number of women on Rosenstrasse increases. Unarmed, unorganized, and leaderless, these courageous women, some with their children, stood up to the Nazis and demanded the return of their loved ones.The acting and the Rosenstrasse storyline are excellent, however Director von Trotta combines so many intense plots, involving so many people, that the points she most wants to make occasionally become lost in the confusion. We never hear Ruth speak of closure, if in fact she does ever come to grips with her past. The film's conclusion only hints at this. Almost all of her dramatic story is revealed by Lena, who has only second-hand knowledge of the events and no real idea of the child's feelings at the time. Von Trotta's handling of the character study is far too abstract. She is much more successful when portraying the women of Rosenstrasse and their protests and resistance. I must credit her with navigating an intensely emotional story effectively, without falling into sensationalism or melodrama.This is a little known true story of women, who in spite of loss, separation and fear for their loved ones, found the courage to fight back against a brutal Nazi state.

A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0007R4SVI,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[29, 31]","Sean Penn gives a brilliant, compelling performance as Samuel Bicke, a desperate man whose world is falling apart around him. As his everyday life spirals out of control, we observe him lose his already slippery grasp on reality. ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" is loosely based on the true story of a Baltimore man who tried to hijack a commercial airplane and fly it into the White House in 1974.This chilling story unfolds grimly, like a terribly skewed canticle for the prototypical little man, squashed by the system. Writer, and first-time director Niels Mueller succeeds in helping us to understand, and even sympathize with Sam and his troubled life, without manipulating us into condoning his actions. It is 1973 and Sam Bicke's life is already beginning to crumble. His demise plays out against the politically volatile backdrop of the Nixon presidency. Sam and his wife Marie, (Naomi Watts) have been separated for over a year. He obviously loves her and adores their children. She is a hard working cocktail waitress, and it is apparent that one of the reasons their marriage has failed is Bicke's inability to hold down a steady job. When it becomes obvious that she has no interest in getting back together with him, Sam begins to stalk her - although he doesn't see it that way. There is a heartbreaking scene where he pays his family a ""surprise visit,"" and is asked to leave and call before he comes over again. The children go in for dinner, the door closes and Bicke looks longingly at what was once his home. He goes into the yard, hugs his dog, and lovingly puts his hands on a tree in the yard. His anguish and loneliness are palpable.Sam lost his job with his brother's tire company because he believes customers are being cheated by not being told the actual amount of profit the business makes on each tire purchased. He feels a more ethical approach would be to just tell customers the true percentage of profit and offer to split the difference - cut profits in half - rather than lie about giving non-existent special deals and offers. When his best friend tries to explain to him patiently, ""It's not lying, it's business,"" Sam doesn't buy it. He is a man of integrity, a regular guy who works hard and wants a share of the American Dream. However, he lacks the brains and competency to become a successful businessman. Now, newly employed as an office furniture salesman, he discovers that his new boss, (a controlling, gruff Jack Thompson), wants him to lie to customers also. Nervous at work, aware that as a new employee he is being observed, he literally cringes before customers, while his boss subjects him to constant criticism.The one bright spot in Bicke's life is his dream of opening an automobile tire company, operated out of an old school bus, with his auto mechanic friend, Bonny Simmons, a black auto mechanic, (superbly played by Don Cheadle). Sam applies for a bank loan with the Small Business Administration, but cannot get the government to review his application in less than the standard eight-to-ten weeks. Nervous, fearing his application will be denied, he begins to stalk the local loan administrator, obnoxiously pushing to have his paperwork processed faster.Closely identifying with minorities, African Americans and Native Americans, because he feels persecuted and invisible, Bicke pays a visit to the Baltimore chapter of the Black Panthers to donate money. He suggests that they might double their membership if they allowed whites to join their organization and changed their name to The Zebras. It is comical, yes.....and, given Bicke's sincerity, it is heartbreaking also.Sam receives notification, by mail, that the divorce proceedings Marie had instigated, seemingly unbeknownst to him, have been finalized. He had deluded himself into believing they were still working on their relationship. When he tries to contact her at home, she and the children are gone. His loan application is rejected. He quits his job. He totally loses it and explodes in violent, deluded rage.He sees dishonesty, hypocrisy, everywhere, especially in the White House. Sam's boss told him, with admiration, that President Nixon is the world's greatest salesman, because he swindled the American people into voting for him - twice. In 1968 Nixon promised to end the Vietnam War. He did not. He ran on the same premise in 1972, and won again. The president also promised aid for the small businessman, and never delivered - at least not to Sam. Richard Nixon becomes the physical embodiment of all his disappointments, failures, a world gone wrong. When Sam sees news footage of a soldier that stole an Army helicopter and landed it on the front lawn of the White House, he realizes it would not have been difficult to crash it into the President's residence.A self-described grain of sand on the beach of America, Sam chooses composer and orchestra leader, Leonard Bernstein, a man he idolizes, to tell his story. He makes and mails the musician tapes which begin: ""Mr Bernstein: I have the utmost respect for you. Your music is both pure and honest and that is why I have chosen you to present the truth about me to the world."" The film's score contains piano and violin sonatas by Beethoven, and the music provides a particularly moving backdrop, especially during these sequences.This extremely well crafted movie offers insight into the mind of a man who doesn't possess the necessary skills to make it in the world, and who blames society for his own inadequacies. The televised news images of this turbulent period in American history, projected into his living room on a daily basis, further feed his delusions. Bicke's descent into madness is painful to watch. Although this is not a suspense thriller, but a character study - a drama about one man's inability to cope with the stress and harshness of everyday life - the movie is fraught with suspense and tension. One never knows when Bicke will snap. The film's conclusion, although inevitable, is still shocking.A formidable film!JANA",4.0,A terribly skewed canticle for the prototypical little man.,1121644800,"07 18, 2005"

AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B000BX8R1A,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[0, 0]","Ari Posin and Zac Stanford had met years before at a film festival in Houston. They became pals and collaborated on this film, with Zac doing most of the writing, and Ari sitting in the director's chair. One executive producer, Bonnie Curtis, had worked for years for her mentor Steven Spielberg. She took the CHUMSCRUBBER script to him, and he liked it, seeing many of the obvious plot parallels to DREAMWORKS mega-hit, AMERICAN BEAUTY (1999). He shared some comments on what he thought was a third act that seemed much too busy with a swirl of storylines. He did like the fact that CHUMSCRUBBER was very ""edgy"", that it pushed the edge of the envelope. When they filmed BEAUTY, they assumed that it would be completely a comedy, but it morphed into some tremendously dramatic moments. CHUMSCRUBBER had the same kind of dichotomy going for it, even though it was more surreal. Its characters, especially the teenagers could have stepped out of the script for DONNIE DARKO (2001).CHUMSCRUBBER was the feature film debut for director Ari Posin, paralleling Sam Mendes who directed BEAUTY as his feature debut. Posin had graduated from USC a decade earlier, and this film was his first shot at the Hollywood brass ring. His father had been a film director in Russia, before the family fled the repression there and came to America. So Posin grew up in a home where the dinner conversation was centered squarely on cinema. He co-wrote the script, and he understood the necessity to cast strong actors who could meet the challenges on the page. Following Elia Kazan's advice, he tried  not ""to direct too much"" -the cardinal sin for most first time directors.Suburbia is the ""world"" of this dramedy -a sanitized new ticky-tacky housing development called ""Hillside""; the place to play out this dystopian vision. Perhaps it does not play out as heartbreakingly as Gus Van Sant's ELEPHANT (2003), or as realistically, but it is teeming with middle-aged parental characters who must have watched way too much OZZIE & HARRIET, DONNA REED, and FATHER KNOWS BEST reruns. They should have paid more attention to the disturbing goings on along Wisteria Lane on DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, or re-watched THE STEPFORD WIVES (1975), THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998), or even THX 1138 (1971).Jamie Bell [BILLY ELLIOT (2000)] played young protagonist Dean Stiffle with a perfect pitch American accent. His ""Dean"" was a recognizable adolescent, but further burdened with being both an outsider and rebel, and  having a father who was a New Age guru, who used his family's ""dysfunctions"" to write about; especially Dean's. So Dean, like most of his compeers found solace in the swirling miasma of pharmacology that was readily available at their middle class high school. Being stoned led to an easier pretense of ""good behavior"" which kept their parents clueless as to their actual behavior. The parents in this suburb were mostly selfish, inebriated, arrogant, and ignorant, practicing several forms of abandonment effortlessly.Camilla Belle played Crystal, and she was as beautiful as a young Angelina Jolie in HACKERS (1995), and as stunning as the young Elizabeth Taylor in A PLACE IN THE SUN (1951). Belle played Crystal very self-aware of being the prettiest girl in school, mired in shallow selfishness and rebellion, yet nevertheless she began to show indications that she might be ""growing up"", that she might actually be receptive to an honest communication, logic, and tenderness. For a long time she hung out with a cruel posse of drug dealers and ""rinks"", girlfriend to their leader Billy (played impressively by Justin Chatwin). Billy turned out to be both bully and victim.The supporting cast consisted of a number of talented actors, many of them brought on board secondary to the charm of the young director, and some because they liked the irreverent and necessary messages of the film. Ralph Fiennes, Glenn Close, Carrie-Ann Moss, Rita Wilson, Allison Janney, William Fichtner, Rory Culkin, John Heard, and Lauren Holly were the ""dream cast"". Most of the major film critics disliked the film, and felt that the cast were slumming in this ""pretentious Indie"" film. I disagree.

A3T6OR4CAVJDNW,6303265774,Broken_Harlequin,"[3, 3]","Firstly, Hellbound:Hellraiser 2 is not just a second-rate sequel, but expands on, and perhaps even betters it's original.  Now with Hellbound there's really two ways to approch it. #1 is to sit there, wracking your brain, and trying to make sence of the whole thing. And #2 is to put your chair right infront of the T.V., turn the lights down low (to create the horror movie atmosphere)press play, settle down and stare at the screen for a hour and a half.I chose the latter, which was probably for the best, because otherwise I'd probably be up all night. But don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that this movie is confused or that it doesn't make sence or anything. What I mean is that I think they just tried to fit too much into one movie. There's enough matirial for two movies.But, hey I love it. Let's take a look-see: The new characters (Dr.Charnard, Tiffany) are both interesting (perhaps a little disterbed, but who cares?) plus Kirsty returns but Steve managed to slip out of it.But here's the part that trips me up: Dr. Charnard lets a mental paceint slice himself up royaly on the mattress containing Julia's soul,(very nasty) thus resurecting her. Resurecting Julia. Who in their right mind would do it? Well  Dr.Charnard falls in love with her,(and makes out with her) even though she's a skinned corpse (nice, hey?).Anyway off they all head down to hell. Actually I found the concept that everyone has their own, personal hell very intreiging. That was heaps interesting. So anyway everyone's there and basicly all hell breaks loose, thus the expression. Dr. Charnard gets turned into a Cenobite, who's linked directly to Levithan. And so there's another who's trying to kill Kirsty and co. Also Julia gets hers back on Frank for killing her in the original. But I think the best part of all is when Kirsty confronts the Chatterer, Butterball, Pinhead and She-who-must-not-be-named with their own humanity. But God knows how she managed to reconise Pinhead from the picture of Elliot Spencer. But then, God has no part in this flick. Also, I really liked the part in the beginning when they showed us how Elliot Spencer solved the dreaded box and was transformed into the delightfuly nasty demon, Pinhead. A painful and traumatic process, but not half as painful as watching TVSN from 7 til 12, but that's a different story.So it really is quite a good movie with some killer moments. And as for the gore, well there's a (...) load of it. Come on, let's face it; this movie can't go more than 1 minute without spearing, killing, sliceing, diceing, cutting, gutting, you get the idea. But here's the thing with splatfestival movies like Hellboud: they are compleate gross-outs at first, but after a while one just get so used to the grossness of it that the gore just washes over one. That's what I think of that aspect of Hellbound. But hey if I didn't want, dicapitation,skinning,throat cutting and dismembering I should've rented Bambi instead. Am I right? or am I right?This is, without a doubt one of the nastiest, most sadistic movies I have ever witnessed. Infact I wouldn't even call this a movie, it's more like an experience.So all in all I really loved it, delightfully gory.It may even be better original and Hellraiser 3.

As for the DVD features, they are solid. The first is s brief 12 minute short film Tarr made in 1978, called Hotel Magnezit which depicts an aging alcoholic who is persecuted by unknown others for alleged wrongdoings. It is not in good shape, visually, and the acting is very poor, to say the least. It's at best, a misfire. Then there is a near 50 minute long press conference at the Berlinale Film Festival, wherein Tarr, his three main actors, and his technical collaborators, answer question from an international group of reporters. While there are a few moments of insight, the stark contrast between the depths of the film and the insipidities of the assorted reporters makes for many awkward moments, where the viewer feels sorry for the questioner and senses the artists' frustrations. There is also the theatrical trailer, and a small booklet with a very poorly written and teeth-gnashingly trite essay, called Brute Existence: The Turin Horse, on the film by American film critic J. Hoberman. Finally there is an audio commentary by another notoriously bad American film critic, Jonathan Rosenbaum, that is one of the worst that you will ever encounter.  It truly does seem that the Golden Age of DVD commentaries is at an end. Aside from the fact that the commentary has silent gaps, it also only runs less than half the length of the film because, as Rosenbaum says early on, he thinks the film needs no commentary. So, then why agree to do the damned thing? Let someone with more enthusiasm take over. As for the actual commentary? It's rather pathetic, for Rosenbaum adds almost nothing original, instead mostly reading others' critical opinions on the film, and then even relying on biographical and career information on Tarr from, of all places, the always unreliable Wikipedia. It's truly an astonishing train wreck of a commentary- one which Rosenbaum calls his first solo commentary, and hopefully, for the cineastes out there, what will be his last commentary. Aside from the absolute lack of anything meaningful to say on the film, Rosenbaum's nasal, screechy voice is a turn-off, but even more so is his constant pimping of his own career, and the fact that he is going to be teaching, in 2013 at a new film school Tarr is opening in Croatia. About the only positives that one can say of Rosenbaum's nearly 70 minutes of speaking is that he makes two salient points that few other critics have noticed: 1) that despite being labeled anti-Hollywood, Tarr's films are often shot on sets, and Rosenbaum claims this film was also shot on a soundstage. 2) He acknowledges that Tarr's camera is always doing something interesting to offset the seeming repetition of the activities the characters engage in, and this counterpoint between action and depiction helps craft a grand narrative from what seems to be little material. Other than these two points, Rosenbaum's relentless need to posit himself as an insider into indy film circles, and his utter lack of insight into the film at hand, make listening to the commentary a chore.While the film was much honored at a number of the international film festivals it was shown at, it did not make the list for best Foreign Picture Oscars in America (surprise, surprise). Yet, despite this snub, The turin Horse is yet another great film in Tarr's canon, at least equal to Damnation and Satantango, clearly superior to The Man From London, even if it likely falls a bit shy of Tarr's greatest film, Werckmeister Harmonies. It is a brutally great work of realism in an oddly closed universe consisting of one windy plain (see the scene where the pair try to leave their home, only to wind up right back in it). Near the end of the film, the unnamed daughter asks of her father, or perhaps rhetorically (it does not matter), What is all this darkness?Let me answer: it is art, child.

A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,8371341318,F. S. L'hoir,"[4, 4]","Collaborating for a third time with director Carol Reed [""Fallen Idol""; ""The Third Man""], Graham Greene has written a script, based upon his novel ""Our Man in Havana,"" which effervesces like vintage champagne, its humor, both dry and subtle, radiating a brilliance that obscures the fact that this black-and-white film was made in 1957, during the height of the Cold War.The unlikely plot to which John Le Carr&eacute; would later pay homage with ""Tailor of Panama,"" is made entirely plausible due to the nuanced performance of the incomparable Alec Guinness, whose portrayal of Wormold, the seller of ""Atomic Pile Vacuums"" in a seedy pre-Castro Havana, ranges between bemused ineptitude and faux confidence and sophistication as he improvises on the tradecraft of espionage, a profession that has been thrust upon him. Much of the humor, in fact derives from his bumbling efforts to recruit agents. The felicitous combination of Greene and Reed ensures that the humor gradually assumes ominous overtones as Wormold's deception is quickly swallowed whole by one side of the espionage game and slowly detected and regurgitated by the other. Given the fact that the film was made before the Cuban Missile Crisis, the drawings of ""secret installations"" in the heart of Cuba provides the viewer with a chilling verisimilitude in hindsight.Burl Ives, who was noted primarily for folk-singing, turns in a more-than-competent performance as Wormold's enigmatic friend, a doctor and German First-World-War veteran, whose part in the affair is never completely explained. Although Ernie Kovacs' performance of the dastardly chief of police, Captain Segura, borders on caricature, one cannot imagine anyone else playing the character in any other manner. And while I was never quite convinced by Jo Morrow in the role of the precocious convent daughter--she seems a bit too mature--the rest of the cast, which includes Maureen O'Hara as the skilled secretary that London sends to back up their most valuable asset in the Caribbean, is thoroughly credible.Only Graham Greene could concoct this deliciously sardonic spoof on the Secret Intelligence Service in which he served during World War II. All the fabled real-life stereotypes are present and accounted for: Noel Coward as an Old Boy who, impervious to the raucous importunings of maracas-wielding street singers, strides stiffly through the steamy boulevards of Havana in a three-piece suit, bowler hat on head and umbrella in hand; Ralph Richardson as ""C,"" the all-for-expedience Director, who hears what he wants to hear (transforming what has been described to him as a smalltime salesman into a ""merchant adventurer""); the stammering spy obsessed with his pipe (reminiscent of a notorious mole under whom Greene served in real life), working for the Other Side. All contribute a note of Cold War reality to this tongue-in-cheek tale of espionage. Underlying the humor, however, lurks a question, later asked by John Le Carr&eacute;: are intelligence services sometimes too willing to believe in expedient scenarios that seem clearly delineated--and therefore too good to be true, when actual events may prove to be other than they seem.Except for the original theatrical trailer, the extras are eminently trivial and not worth watching. This fact, however, should not prevent one from buying this DVD, which, presented in letter-box form, to preserve the original Cinemascope presentation, is not to be missed.Enjoy!",5.0,Not to Be Missed!,1234569600,"02 14, 2009"

I thought it would be full of Hollywood tripe. For those of you who either don't know or don't want to admit the facts, Alexander the Great was an incredibly tough homosexual man who conquored most of the known world during his time. He was an amazing man who overthrew wicked dicators much more bloodthirsty than he was, and he brought peace and prosperity to much of his lands for a time.The fact he was a homosexual is VERY important...because his most elite army was also homosexual. The bonds and love and lust and life these men shared helped lead them to their victories. Oliver Stone did a superb job in portraying Alexander as 'bisexual', which is ok, because Alexander as King did have an obligation to marry and procreate. And I'm sure he loved his wife, but not in the same way he loved his life partner, best friend, and male lover, Hephaestion. Stone did a remarkable job in helping to bring this love into the light.Apart from Alexander's sexuality, there is a wealth of characters and influences and causes and passions surrounding his life which do make a very compelling story.

Unfortunately, after being intrigued by the trailer, I found that this movie is not all all what is advertised.For a basic plot summary, ""Being John Malkovich"" sees an eccentric puppeteer (Jon Cusack) finding a portal that leads into the mind of actor John Malkovich (John Malkovich).  Chaos then ensues when the experience is turned into a profit-making venture.Put simple, this is an artsy, ""concept"" film if ever one was created.  Many themes in the film are interesting and have potential to really intrigue, but all are eschewed in favor of oblique artistic expression.  Basically, it is impossible to ever ""figure out"" this film.  The characters are outlandish, the plot is all over the place, and the themes are far too frequent and passing to piece together coherently.I liken the experience to watching Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"".  The visuals are nice and the content seems thought-provoking, but you'll go stark raving mad if you actually try to figure everything out.  For director Spike Jonze, the overall artistic expression far outweighs a coherent narrative.Thus, if you are a fan of out-of-the-box, visually striking film-making, this will be your ""Citizen Kane"".

Literally, run out and see it.  Now.  You'll not see a finer ensemble movie this year.  Then,2. Don't read anymore of this review until you do.I am breaking from tradition here.  Generally, I like to write reviews that praise or criticize movies, making sure to tell minimal plot details and, above all else, not to divulge spoilers that might ruin the story for anyone who has not seen it.  This will not be the case here; I was moved enough by this superb movie to want to talk freely about it, and you should STOP HERE IF SPOILERS WILL UPSET YOU.""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a masterful contradiction: a mainstream movie shot like an indie, its rough edges are expressed in broad strokes as well as personal details.  It is loud yet minimal; it is personal, yet speaks to all of us.  It is a movie that is probably about no one you can think of, yet it will resonate with an intimacy that will speak to all of us.""We're not liars like they are,"" Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence in a bravura performance) said in defining her relationship with Pat (Bradley Cooper, truly splendid in this role), and she's right: their respective brushes with mental disorder have somehow left them without the ability to restrain the words we all think but never say.These moments create comedy, but they can also be very uncomfortable.  We find out early they are broken people.  Pat, a teacher, was institutionalized for eight months after he left school early one day, found his wife in the shower with a fellow teacher and almost beat him to death.  Upon Pat's release he is invited to his friend Ronny's house for dinner and it is there he meets the recently widowed Tiffany, whose policeman husband died behind the wheel.  Though Ronnie specifically cautions him not to, his first words to her are, ""How did your husband die?""It is a potentially alienating question, as is their conversation about the medication prescribed to ""help"" them.  Yet Tiffany responds to his honesty and a potential shaky bond is formed.  This candor is foreign to their host; Ronny himself had only just confessed to Pat how the very home improvements he had moments ago been bragging about are strangling him financially.  Urged by Pat to say this to his wife, his host frantically hushes him lest his wife might hear.This openness has its limits; due to the particulars of her relationship with her husband at the time of his death Tiffany is now a recovering sex addict, and Pat's tendency to continually call her a ""slut"" quickly wears thin.  And his inability to see beyond his need to rehabilitate his relationship with his ex-wife Nikki is a continual barrier to his relationship with Tiffany moving forward.Make no doubt about it: Pat is a broken man.  In fact, there are several scenes in the early part of the movie where Pat is seen reading Hemingway'sA Farewell To Armsin an effort to come to fully embrace his wife by reading her curriculum for the school year.  We laugh when he reads the ending of the novel and flings it out the window of his attic bedroom.  ""That book sucks!"" he shouts, complaining about the book's ending, wherein two lovers undergo tremendous hardships in WWI, escape to Switzerland and, when they are finally safe, she dies in childbirth.  He is enraged that Hemingway had the audacity to consider THAT a good and proper ending to a book.  (We'll return to AFTA later.)What is so refreshing about ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is how it all fits together so well and bears up under further scrutiny beyond the simple words of the script.  Their drama may not be Shakespearean in language, but it is still one we recognize as eternal, and digging for symbols is a task refreshingly rewarded.That Pat wears a black Hefty bag through which he's poked neck and arm holes is attributed to the moist Pennsylvanian weather, yet the fact that he sees himself as trash is not without merit.  He is continuously trying to better himself and his station so that Nikki will take him back, yet he is forever stymied by the court order forcing them apart.  That Tiffany offers to carry his letter to Nikki gives her a reason to see him, but her terms of the bargain forces him to continuously practice with her so that she may enter a dance contest some weeks away.  He agrees not only for the purpose of passing on the letter, but so that Nikki may see that he is bettering himself.That Tiffany and Pat's first evening takes place on Halloween bears up as well, as they are the only ones that day unmasked.  Once inside the modest diner he has taken her to he, hilariously, orders Raisin Bran--the breakfast cereal--to make sure their night together is not seen as a formal date.  Understandably, their meal ends with her soon after storming out the door, and in her anger she cries out when he tries to mend things, arousing the public to her cause.  It is her betrayal of him that causes her to see him as a trapped and flawed individual, and she quickly calls off his tormentors.He is alone (his last name, after all, is Solitano), as she is, and he needs someone fiercely--he simply has picked the wrong horse.  For a movie that relies upon gambling so much (more about that later on), is such a metaphorical comparison out of line?It is also at that moment that she witnesses the anguish he feels whenever he hears the Stevie Wonder song ""My Cherie Amour,"" which was not only his wedding song but the song playing while his wife and her lover were showering.  Throughout the early part of this movie the song has plagued him, yet it is Tiffany's penchant for cutting through the superficial that causes her to shout, ""It's just a song; it's not a monster!"" and it is then he finally begins to place the song in perspective.I have not even touched on the wonderful secondary characters in the movie--and how often can one apply such a term to Robert De Niro?  His character of Pat, Sr., has lost his job and is relying upon bookmaking to fund his construction of a restaurant he has dreamed about running all of his life.  While such a dream drives the action of the second half of ""Silver Linings,"" perhaps more important is De Niro's skilled portrayal of a faulted man run by his compulsions, a psychological disorder that also, certainly, had something to do with the Pat's upbringing.  He is a Philadelphia Eagles fanatic; he has recorded and catalogued every game they ever played.  This is odd, but perhaps not worthy of being called ""crazy""; yet we soon find out he has done the same with other items in his house, including blank envelopes. Now, THIS is a compulsion worthy of merit.That Cooper's Pat has trouble with De Niro's Pat is not hard to fathom: after all, his father's repeated pleas to simply spend time with his son at first come across as a man's earnest desire to reconnect with his offspring, and we at first see the younger Pat as being callous for neglecting him.  Yet it is only later that we realize his father really has been harboring a secret motivation: he sees his son as ""lucky"" and wants to use him as one of his ever-present talisman.It is wholly appropriate that when this all reaches a peak, it is Tiffany who sees them through it.In fact, a few revelations later we find it is, as usual, the women who have been pulling the strings all along.  Not only did Tiffany, as she put it, ""do my research"" and point out to Pat, Sr. that his son has been a good luck talisman all along when in HER presence, but we find too that it is Pat's mother who had secretly helped Tiffany corner Pat all along.But the climactic scenes, wherein EVERYTHING comes to a head--the relationship, the dance contest, the restaurant wager and the all-important meeting between Pat and his ex-wife Nikki--Tiffany and Pat finally reveal to each other their love.  ""I loved you when I first met you,"" he declares, ""I just didn't know it at the time.""This is where the movie at once and at last unites with Hollywood and gives us the ""proper"" ending we've hoped for all along--against Hemingway's nihilism and against the cynicism one might expect here.  It is proper, though, that this one hope goes along with Hemingway's famous quote from ""A Farewell to Arms"" (as long as one doesn't read much farther): ""The world breaks everyone, and afterward many are strong in the broken places.""It is quite possible to see just how Pat and Tiffany are, indeed, ""stronger at the broken places,"" and may now achieve their Hollywood ending after all.*  *  *  *  *NOTE: As I write this, Jennifer Lawrence has just picked up a Golden Globe for her stellar performance (it was up for four); that Bradley cooper lost to Daniel Day Lewis in ""Lincoln"" is nothing to be ashamed of.

A35U2FY3ZWLGDH,6304290888,"Jerrod Maruyama ""mediaboy""","[9, 13]","It was a strange move for Disney.  After phenomenal success with animated features like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King, the animation studio took a risk.  Feeling audiences were tiring of the same ol' song and dance routine, Disney Animation branched out into other narrative territories.  A brave move indeed seeing as the studio had the biggest animated film of all time (The Lion King) and the only animated feature to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar (Beauty and the Beast) under their belts.  The results of such daring and ambitious  aspirations were...well mixed.  For no one thought Victor Hugo's dark story and Disney's bright storytelling was a perfect match.  One can certainly see the appeal of that juxtaposition as a challenge.  The artists must have been thrilled to explore gothic architecture and cathedrals that served as the stories setting.  That inspiration came through loud and clear in the film's design and it's intricate backgrounds.  Notre Dame literally dwarfs everything around it and this concept was beautifully taken to an extreme in the film's design.  The character animation in this film is also amazing.  Movement and timing are perfect, a rather amazing feat given the unusually sophisticated character designs.  Re-watching this film illustrates how almost flawless the animation is.  Noteably, a dancing gypsy evolves out of the flames in an extremely dark  (by Disney standards) but memorably striking song.  With all this style and talent it's a shame the film lacked the magic and graceful storytelling of the Ashman and Menken years.  Too often this duo is reduced to a musical comedy team, a witty laugh factory utilizing the Broadway mentality.  But they knew how to tell a story and tell it well with real emotion and character development.  They used all the elements Walt had established as well as the strengths of musical theater.  They didn't so much re-define the animated feature as much as they perfected it.  Without their graceful touch on this film as well as Pocahontas, the magic was lost.  The songs were nice but not  memorable.  The characters were never fully developed though wonderfully voiced by Kevin Kline, Tom Hulce and Demi Moore.  Technincally this film is outstanding but it takes more to please the heart than it does to please the eyes.",3.0,Quasi-Disney,1016064000,"03 14, 2002"

Unfortunately, I'm almost thirty, and the real reason I bought this flick was for my four-year-old daughter to enjoy.  She liked it well enough, but it has many themes in it that are a little bit over her young head.  Also, there are a couple of words in it(hell and crap), that some parents may not want their youngsters hearing.That being said, this is a great film for older children to watch.  Much like ""Atlantis:  The Lost Empire,"" ""El Dorado"" has plenty of action and even a little suspense that will definitely trigger the imaginations of youngsters who dream of being pirates, Indiana Jones, treasure hunters, etc.The story begins with Miguel and Tulio, two generally low-brow scalawags trying to cheat their way to riches in a game of dice.  They gain a map in their victory but are quickly found out to be cheats.  They hide in barrels in order to get away from the authorities and those that they had cheated, but are placed on a ship headed for the New World.  They manage to escape at sea and find themselves beached at El Dorado, the legendary city of gold.  They are mistaken for gods and are treated as such.  Along the way, they stockpile as many of the natives' riches that they can, but in the end, they must make a huge moral decision that leads to a swashbuckling conclusion.With the voice talents of Kevin Kline, Rosie Perez, Edward James Olmos, and the wonderful Kenneth Branagh, ""The Road To El Dorado"" is essentially a buddy flick for the younger crowd, though this oldster found himself enjoying this film quite a bit.  The music, by Elton John and Tim Rice, is ultimately forgettable, but the score, by Hans Zimmer, is much more memorable.Pick this flick up for your older kids.  Younger children may not catch the bulk of the humor in this film, but the comedy provided by Altivo, a horse, is sure to get some laughs out of them.Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys adventure films like all of the Indiana Jones flicks and even ""The Goonies.""",4.0,Wonderful Adventure Tale,1140048000,"02 16, 2006"

ASZGADJQT6ET4,B007L6VR12,Adam Gagnon,"[3, 8]","From my site, [...]The audiences&#8217; enjoyment of Moonrise Kingdom really depends on their like for Wes Anderson movies. If only one thing can be said about Wes Anderson it&#8217;s that he definitely has his own style. Anderson movies are usually slower paced in oddly detailed environments with intelligent dialogue and a sense of comedy that is exceptionally dry. Moonrise Kingdom is no exception to these conventions, however it falls short because all of the oddities don&#8217;t amount to anything of particular interest this time.Moonrise Kingdom is a love story between children. Sam (Jared Gilman) is a Khaki Scout who leaves the organization to run away with a local girl, Suzy (Kara Hayward). When his escape is discovered by Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton) an investigation is started involving the rest of the scouts and the Captain of the local police, Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis). Bill Murray and Frances McDormand are the Bishops, Suzy&#8217;s parents. The two are very confrontational and constantly get in the way of the search for the run away kids. There is never a sense of danger for the movie, that&#8217;s not what Moonrise Kingdom is about. It is a quirky love story set in a real enough era but with a surreal twist.The movie never ramps up enough that the audience is on the edge of their seat about anything. There is no question about the progression of the movie or the end results. Even when new elements are introduced to the audience it is clear where things are going to end up.Moonrise Kingdom boasts a very solid cast but no breakout performances. Gilman and Hayward are solid child actors but the deadpan delivery that comes with Anderson movies may be the cause for that. Bill Murray is a staple in Anderson movies and usually provides a good amount of the offbeat humor. In Kingdom he is more a placeholder than anything. Frances McDormand has never been a great actress, she got lucky with Fargo and that is the sole reason she continues to receive acting work. Edward Norton was probably the funniest performance of the movie. Norton is usually an edgy and very serious actor but in Kingdom he plays the complete opposite.Unfortunately the movie lacked substance so there isn&#8217;t much more to say. It&#8217;s one of Anderson&#8217;s weaker movies. In a year filled with amazing performances, break out stars, and truly original movies it is a complete mystery how Moonrise Kingdom got nominated for an Academy Award at all.",2.0,My Moonrise Kingdom Review,1368489600,"05 14, 2013"
A1XKI53W1E891T,B000KWZ7VU,Amy,"[4, 4]","Beethoven was a revolutionary man living in a revolutionary time. He captured his inner voice, demons and all and the spirit of his time, and in doing so, created a body of music the likes of which no one had ever before imagined. A virtuoso at the keyboard, Beethoven used the piano as his personal musical laboratory, and the piano sonata became, more than any other genre of music, a place where he could experiment with harmony and his developing view of music as a self expressive art. Spanning the length of his compositional career, Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas provide a window into his personal musical development, and they show the concept of the piano as an instrument and the piano sonata as a genre undergoing an extraordinary evolution. The sonatas are not simply compositions for the piano, but are about the developing technology of the piano itself, an evolving instrument that Beethoven pushed to its limits and then beyond, ultimately writing music for an idealized piano that didn't come into existence until about 40 years after he died. Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas include some of his most popular works that took him about 30 years to compose gradually transforming a medium that Mozart and Haydn had already turned into a staple of Classical expression to a vehicle for personal expression that takes us to the time of 19th century Romanticism. These works were very much intended for home entertainment, and Beethoven initially continued that tradition by writing a number of works for his students to play. But as he began to be affected by deafness, playing the piano became his only tangible means of, as it were, 'hearing' music.There's no denying Beethoven's capacity for communing with the soul through his piano. The adventures in form and musical working out of ideas were all part of this need to say things in music that had never been said before. Beethoven was constantly striving for more, particularly in range and dynamic capability. As an example, he composed the ""Hammerklavier"" Sonata about seven years before he had a piano that could cope with its demands of register. He often said, ""The whole tribe of pianoforte manufacturers have been swarming around me in their anxiety to serve me and all for nothing."" Just one more example of the way Beethoven in his sonatas was always ahead of the game.  In this 6 DVD set Daniel Barenboim does an amazing job of playing all of Beethoven's sonatas and what truly baffles and impresses me the most every time I watch this set is that he plays them all by memory. This is a wonderful set and anyone interested in seeing Beethoven's sonatas performed will not be disappointed.  Truly, Beethoven's piano music is his voice, emerging from his mind, through his fingers, to our ears and hearts. And his piano sonatas are, more than any other of his amazing works, his personal testament, expressed in his own voice.",5.0,Daniel Barenboim plays all of Beethoven's Sonatas,1199664000,"01 7, 2008"
